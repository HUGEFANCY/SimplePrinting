# Simple 3D-printing / Gcode-creation with Grasshopper

Repository for simple 3D-printing algorithms in [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/). 

Intended to be used with the [HugeFancy 3D-Printer](www.hugefancy.com), but works with any Machine that can run G-code.  


## Different Algorithms:

### PrintTheseCurves.gh

Simply takes any set of curves from Rhino, divides each curve and adds an extrusion value to each movement.
